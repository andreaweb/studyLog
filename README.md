STUDY LOG

I've been studying programming, design and related subjects for years now; but due to the variety in the field, I was quite unfocused. 
I decided that keeping a more specific track of what I study would help me realize what and how fast I'm learning, figure out the more efficient ways, etc.
Plus, it could help others figure out the best path too!

Used HTML, CSS and Angular.JS.

Project is unfinished, I'll create an issues list soon.

A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
